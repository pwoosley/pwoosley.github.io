<h2 id="introduction-">Introduction üßë‚Äçüî¨</h2>

<p>Labs provide hands-on experience with course material. They have three parts: review questions, guided exercise, open-ended exercise.</p>

<p>The first few Labs provide practice with fundamentals, and the later Labs go hand-in-hand with the term project check-ins.</p>

<p>Tips are at the very bottom. You should read them.</p>

<h2 id="part-13-review-questions">Part 1/3: Review Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>What is the value of this expression in Python? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 * 2 + 3 / 2</code></li>
  <li>What order are the subexpressions evaluated in the expression in the previous question?</li>
  <li>What is the value of this expression in Python? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 + 2 ** 3 / 2</code></li>
  <li>What order are the subexpressions evaluated in the expression in the previous question?</li>
  <li>What is the value of this expression in Python? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max(1, -4, min(3, 18), -7)</code></li>
  <li>What order are the subexpressions evaluated in the expression in the previous question?</li>
  <li>Imagine writing program. First you create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = 3</code>. Then you create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y = 2*x</code>. Then you update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x = 9</code>. What is the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> at this point in the program, and why?</li>
  <li>(Come back and answer this question after completing the rest of the assignment) What problems, if any, did you encounter at any point in this Lab? What did you do to overcome them?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-23-guided-exercise">Part 2/3: Guided Exercise</h2>

<p>For this first Lab let‚Äôs practice a little of all the pieces we will work with later. The goal of this is to make sure everything works so that we can fix problems now instead of later; also, so that when you work with these tools later, it won‚Äôt be the first time you are seeing them. We‚Äôll be putting together a rather complex GUI for showing and interacting with plots. In your term project you‚Äôll do something <em>similar</em>, but focused around a topic of your choice. We‚Äôll talk more about that though in the Check-in activities, and we‚Äôll break this kind of programming into <em>much</em> smaller pieces in the other Labs.</p>

<p>First, decide how you will run Python. (Options in Journal 1.)</p>

<p>My preference is that you run everything for this class in Repl.it. To do this, visit <a href="https://repl.it/">https://repl.it/</a> and sign up for a free account. Once you are logged in, visit <a href="https://repl.it/new/python3">https://repl.it/new/python3</a> to create a new Python repl. Repl.it will automatically install any libraries for you that you might need.</p>

<p><em>** LIBRARY INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS IF RUNNING PYTHON LOCALLY - SKIP IF YOU USE REPLIT **</em></p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are running Python on your own computer, then you will need to install a few libraries. Do this by creating a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code>, put the following in it‚Ä¶</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">matplotlib==3.5.1
pandas==1.3.5
requests==2.26.0
parse==1.19.0
pygubu==0.18.1
</code></pre>

<p>‚Ä¶, then open a command prompt and run:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python <span class="nt">-m</span> pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-U</span> pip
pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>** END OF LIBRARY INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS IF RUNNING PYTHON LOCALLY **</em></p>

<p>Second, download the data that you will need for this Lab by right clicking this link, <a href="assets/lab1_data.csv">lab1_data.csv</a>, and saving the link as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1_data.csv</code>. Do NOT just click the link and open it in Excel/etc., as those tools can change the formatting of the data. (This was a very common cause of headaches in past semesters, so we‚Äôre practicing it up front.)</p>

<p>Do the same to download <a href="assets/lab1_design.ui">lab1_design.ui</a> and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1_design.ui</code>.</p>

<p>Third, let‚Äôs put the data file next to your Python code. To do this, if you are on Repl.it, click the three dots / upload file. If you are on your own computer, then create a new Python file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>, save it somewhere easy to find, and make sure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1_data.csv</code> file is saved right next to it.</p>

<p>Do the same to put the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1_design.ui</code> file next to your Python code.</p>

<p>Fourth, start with this Python code (copy and paste into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code> file) and run it:</p>

<p>You should see a window appear with a horizonal bar plot. The plot shows the percentage of paragraphs written by each of the three Bronte sisters that mention some form of ‚Äútea.‚Äù We can see that Emily mentions ‚Äútea‚Äù (as I defined it in my scraping logic) most frequently. I know that Charlotte mentioned tea the most, but she also wrote more than her sisters overall, so taking the average cancelled that out a bit.</p>

<p>On Repl.it you might get a ‚ÄúMatplotlib created a temporary config/cache‚Äù error message, but that is normal, just ignore those.</p>

<p>If you have some other error message, it may be because one or both of your data files are not next to your python code. If not that, it could be because one of your files is not named <em>exactly</em> the same as the python code expects it to be. And if not that, it could be that you did not download the files by right-click/save-as exactly as instructed above: If you instead left-clicked on the CSV file link and it opened in your computer‚Äôs spreadsheet editor, then when you saved it from there, your editor could have changed the formatting from what the code above expected. (These were the common headaches I‚Äôve seen at this point in the past.)</p>

<p>Once you have this step working, take a screenshot showing me your code and your results and embed that as the first part of your answer to this activity.</p>

<p>Fifth, modify the code to show mentions of some form of ‚Äúcrying.‚Äù Do this by changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y="TEA"</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y="CRY"</code> around line 38.</p>

<p>Once you have that working, take and embed another screenshot showing me the updated code and result.</p>

<p>Sixth, modify the code to show TEA and CRY at the same time. Do this by changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y="CRY"</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y=["TEA", "CRY"]</code>. Embed another screenshot of the updated code and results.</p>

<p>Seventh, take a look at the contents of the two files I asked you to download. Give a brief, precise, and accurate statement describing the overall structure and content of each file. What kind of information is in it? How is that information structured, organized, formatted? If you were to change these files, what effects do you think it would have on your results (assuming you don‚Äôt cause an error)?</p>

<p>Finally, interpret your results. Do you believe this data we‚Äôve collected about these three authors tells us anything interesting about their writing? Why or why not? What are the limitations of just looking at plots? What other ideas for your app can you think of that would make it more interactive for helping the user understand the differences between the authors, answering questions the user might have about the texts, etc.?</p>

<h2 id="optional-fun-exercise">Optional Fun Exercise</h2>

<p>This is completely optional, not worth extra credit or anything, just a fun warm up. I do encourage you to, as you best see fit, try basing a few Tinker journals on these optional exercises though.</p>

<p>Start a new python project on Repl.it with this code:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Load...
</span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="n">turtle</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Turtle</span>

<span class="c1"># Initialize...
</span><span class="n">tim</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Turtle</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Draw!
</span><span class="n">tim</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">tim</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">right</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">tim</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">forward</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add to and modify the code (trial and error) to make these shapes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a square</li>
  <li>a rectangle</li>
  <li>a triangle (any kind)</li>
  <li>a house</li>
  <li>a five-point star</li>
</ul>

<p>Embed screenshots showing me your art!</p>

<h2 id="part-33-open-ended-exercise">Part 3/3: Open-Ended Exercise</h2>

<p>Be sure to see the tips section below.</p>

<p>Create a simple Python program on your own that does these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reads an integer from the keyboard and saves it into a variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code></li>
  <li>Reads another integer in and save it into a variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code></li>
  <li>Makes a variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">added</code> set equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A + B</code></li>
  <li>Similarly, makes variables named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subtracted</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiplied</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">divided</code></li>
  <li>Displays a message like, ‚ÄúThe value of {A‚Äôs value here} + {B‚Äôs value here} is {added‚Äôs value here}‚Äù</li>
  <li>Displays a similar message for the other three variables we made</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if I enter 3 then 5, your program should display this message:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">The value of 3 + 5 is 8
The value of 3 - 5 is -2
The value of 3 * 5 is 15
The value of 3 / 5 is 0.6
</code></pre>

<p>Embed screenshots showing your final code and your results. Show results for a few different runs of your program on different inputs.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Complete Parts 1, 2, and 3 in a single Word/etc. document, then submit your document as a Word or PDF file (NOT a .pages file) to Blackboard.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Each Lab is worth 6/100 towards your final grade.</p>

<p>6/6 - Great job, maximum points! The student completes the Lab accurately and sufficiently and honestly, demonstrating the best of their ability.</p>

<p>3/6 - Student completes most but not all of the Lab. Or, student completes the Lab, but only to the minimal letter of the prompt, not actually applying the concepts of the unit. If you encounter problems or have questions, be sure to email me well before 24 hours before the due date, then continue to attempt to resolve the issue on your own while you wait for a reply.</p>

<p>1/6 - Student completes less than half of the Lab with sufficient work, or student leaves entire sections blank. Make sure that you are leaving yourself enough time to complete assignments, as usually students submit incomplete work because they were rushed at the last minute.</p>

<p>0/6 - Student does not submit on time or submits plagiarized or unacceptable work. Double check that you have submitted the right file, as usually students get zeros because they submitted a previous week‚Äôs work by accident.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p><strong>How Do I Take a Screenshot?</strong></p>

<p>In Windows: Open your Start menu and search for the Snipping Tool. Use that.</p>

<p>In Mac: Cmd+Ctl+Shift+4, then Cmd+V into your Word document</p>

<p>In Linux: If you have a GNOME shell, I recommend the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/">Screenshot Tool</a> extension.</p>

<p>On a Chromebook: I recommend the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl">Full Page Screen Capture</a> extension.</p>

<p><strong>How Do I read an Integer from the Keyboard?</strong></p>

<p>I recommend reading <a href="https://pythonexamples.org/python-read-number-from-console/">https://pythonexamples.org/python-read-number-from-console/</a></p>

<p><strong>How do I Display Values inside a Message?</strong></p>

<p>I recommend reading about f-strings from <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/">https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/</a></p>
