      <h1 id="studio-1-undedited">Studio 1 (undedited)</h1>

<h2 id="string-tools-">String Tools üé≠</h2>

<p>Studios are based on the idea of learning how to code by watching successful coders code.</p>

<p>In this assignment you will watch two videos on this week‚Äôs topic; then you will record a meeting with your Studio Group to discuss; then you will respond with a comment on another group‚Äôs recording.</p>

<p>Recordings are due on a Friday, responses are due on a Sunday.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>First, as soon as possible, agree on a time with your Studio Group to meet virtually. Schedule this meeting on Microsoft Teams.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(To schedule on Teams, visit teams.microsoft.com. Sign-in with your school email. Go to the Calendar tab. Click New Meeting / Schedule Meeting in the top right. Add a title like ‚ÄúStudio 1 Group 1,‚Äù invite all the members of your team, quadruple check that you have the correct date and time, then click Save.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, watch these two videos:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zzj44GipUDQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zzj44GipUDQ</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQQsYXa1EHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQQsYXa1EHs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As you watch, jot down techincal terms, or questions you have, that the video does not define/answer for you.</p>

<p>Third, pick four of the terms/questions you jotted down (two for each video). Search online for answers, and remember where you found your answers so you can cite them later.</p>

<p>Fourth, meet with your group on Microsoft Teams. Elect someone to lead, keep the overall meeting less than 30 minutes, everyone should answer every question, everyone has two minutes to speak before someone else should have a turn, and keep your video and audio on as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(To meet on Teams, go to the Calendar tab on Teams. Click on the meeting you want to join, then click Join in the top right.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fifth, turn on recording, then discuss the questions below. You will submit a copy of this recording when you are done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(To record on Teams, look for the ‚Äúthree dots‚Äù button that appears when you hover your mouse around the bottom-center of the call screen. Click the three dots, then click Start Recording. When you are done, click Stop Recording. A few minutes after you stop, Microsoft Stream will send you an email saying your recording is ready.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, after all groups submit, watch another group‚Äôs discussion and respond with a polite and meaningful comment.</p>

<h2 id="questions-for-discussion">Questions for Discussion</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Names? It‚Äôs a <em>lot</em> easier to make sure everyone gets their points if the recording starts with a quick round of names.</li>
  <li>In each video, was the speaker clear? Was the sound and video quality clear? Was the delivery professional? How would you rate the final product/message of the video? Good? Bad? Amazing? Needs Improvement? Just ‚ÄúMeh‚Äù? Why do you say so, what was good / what could be better?</li>
  <li>In each video, do you believe the speaker provided sufficient background information/links to the tools/data/research they used? What were these? Which were missing? Why do you say so, what was good / what could be better?</li>
  <li>In each video, what course concepts did the speaker demonstrate? How were these used successfully or unsuccessfully to accomplish the goal the speaker had? Give specific examples from what you remember.</li>
  <li>What terms/questions did you research? What answers did you find? Share your citation links with the leader so they can submit them later.</li>
  <li>Next, everyone share your current brainstorming ideas about your project, ask each other for feedback, and help each other flesh out their ideas.</li>
  <li>Finally, what skills, techniques, tools, lines of thinking, designs, etc. from all of this Studio‚Äôs videos and discussion would you like to ‚Äústeal‚Äù for your own work?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Only the team leader needs to submit the recording. Download your group‚Äôs recording from Microsoft Streams, then upload your video to a new thread on the Studio 1 discussion board.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(Download your recording by clicking the ‚Äúthree dots‚Äù on web.microsoftstream.com/studio/videos. Do not accidentally click the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù button near the ‚Äúdownload video‚Äù button. Then in Blackboard, create a new discussion board thread for this Studio and click Browse Local Files. Attach your video file to your post. If your recording file is greater than 100mb, you <strong>might</strong> run into problems when uploading. If that happens, email me <strong>ASAP</strong> and let me know all the details of what happened.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Each Studio is worth 4/100 towards your final grade.</p>

<p>4/4 - Discussion recording was submitted on Friday or sooner, discussion covered all required topics while leaving room for new ideas, you contributed equally with the other members of your group, and you responded with a meaningful comment to at least one other group</p>

<p>3/4 - Discussion recording was submitted on Friday or sooner, but the discussion was lacking, or you contributed only the bare minimum in your group‚Äôs discussion, or you responded with the bare minimum to one other group</p>

<p>1/4 - Discussion recording was submitted after Friday, or you did not contribute at all in your group, or you did not respond at all to one other group</p>

<p>0/4 - No submission</p>
