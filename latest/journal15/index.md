# Reading / Journal 15

## Wrap-Up ✏️

## Reading

Team, it's been a long semester. We've dealt with learning software packages for scraping, counting, and visualizing data in Python. We've gotten creative and had to think on our feet when our internet went down, when data we thought was available wasn't, and when the tools we used (like repl.it) had unexpected crashes.

And I'm proud of each of you.

I hope that, over the duration of this course, you've learned a good bit more about data and complexity and analysis and Python's role in all that. I hope you've learned a good bit more about how to stand up to and diagnose error messages head on, how to approach thinking through small but precise programs like they're an old friend, and you've had a good chance to demonstrate that with a project of your own. Our projects were simple. We only had one "complexity point" to spend. We all had to write apps that analyzed real data and that displayed some "result" of it back to the user. They, for the most part, were...less than completely statistically sound. But they worked, and they were focused and meaningful, and that's the goal we had set out to accomplish. We could expand on that in later courses or out in life outside of school. We aren't "done," in human terms. But we are done in semester terms.

As I end all my classes, in what ways has this course challenged you? Feel free to write about this in your journal this week.

**Now watch "What Can You Do with Python? - The 3 Main Applications"** from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLZuut1fYzQ>

So have a great break everyone. Keep up the great work, and I'll see you around!

## Journal

**ONLY OPTION THIS WEEK:** Submit a brief "200+ Words" reflecting on *in what ways has this course challenged you?*

  <h4>❗ Short on Words?</h4>
  <p>Short a few words in your journal and don't know what else to write about?</p>
  <p>This week's "get to know you" question is:</p>
  <em>Share a photo or describe a fashion trend you once loved (and maybe now cringe at). (<a href='https://jonitrythall.com/daily-discussion-prompts-wiggle-work-way' target="_blank">Credit</a>)</em>
  <p>Feel free to write about this a little bit in your journal.</p>
