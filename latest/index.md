# CIT 144: Python I
Welcome in!

On this site I'll post lessons and assignments for our class. I do this because I share a lot of code examples, and they'll look a *lot* better this way than on BlackBoard. You'll still *submit* work through BlackBoard.

## Tip
> If you use Google Chrome, [NaturalReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naturalreader-ai-text-to/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk/) appears to be a decent option for reading our course content out loud. I write a lot for y'all to read. Sometimes having the voice there can help.

## Living Document
I consider this course content a living document. I make changes from semester to semester: students catch errors, I tweak content, sometimes I'm inspired by what other teachers are doing, and periodically links get old and stop working.

If you notice any errors or have small suggestions for tweaks to this content, please either:
- Click the "edit" button on the top of the page you want to propose edits for, login with your Github account (good idea to have one), and make your edits directly. I will review and approve the changes.
- Shoot me an email describing the error or suggestion.
